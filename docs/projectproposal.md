### 1. Purpose:
Fireflow is built for detecting DDoS attack on a targeted network. Below is an image on how Fireflow will be deployed on a network.

The first version of Fireflow will detect the following types of attacks:

- SYN Flood
- UDP Flood
- ICMP Flood

Capturing Engine: PF_RING.

Detection Scheme: Entropy Computing

IP Standard: IPv4.

And in v1.0 it will be only a cmdline tool. 

For the first version, it will only support Port Mirroring, which means it will copy all packets to a designated server. And only traffics from one chosen server will be copied. Once DDoS attack is detected, Fireflow will notify users through the command line.

### 2. Implementation

*[Assigned to: Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·ª©c Anh]*

#### **A. Capturing module** 
Packets are captured from PF_RING. The packet data is then saved into a file for later analysis. Here are the configurations for packet capturing in version 1.0 of Fireflow: 
- Source IP
- Destionation IP
- Source Port
- Destination Port
- Input interface
- Output interface
- IP protocol version
- TTL
- Protocol 
- Packet length
- Number of packets
- Flags
- IP Fragmented
- Timeval ts
- Packet payload full length      

#### **B. Monitoring module**
We utilize the captured data to detect these attacks. In order to observe randomness in a data set of given network traffic, network packet fields can be selected to observe changes. We do not only focus on one attribute like destination IP only. We also focus on other combinations. For different attack types, we consider different packet fields for entropy calculation. 

In general, we consider destination IP, source IP, destination port, source port and packet size
fields of network packet for entropy calculation. 

But each attack detection method is assigned to each member of the team so it is up to them to implement it, with a restriction that the method is based on entropy computing.

**- SYN Flood:** 

The SYN flooding attacks exploit the TCP‚Äôs three-way handshake mechanism and its limitation in maintaining half-open connections. When a server receives a SYN request, it returns a SYN/ACK packet to the client. Until the SYN/ACK packet is acknowledged by the client, the connection remains in halfopen state for a period of up to the TCP connection timeout, which is typically set to 75 seconds. The server has built in its system memory a backlog queue to maintain all half-open connections. Since this backlog queue is of finite size, once the backlog queue limit is reached, all connection requests will be dropped resulting in denial-of-service.
Attackers send SYN packets whose source address Ô¨Åelds are spoofed. The server receiving these SYN packets sends SYN/ACK packets to spoofed addresses. If the spoofed address actually exists, it sends an RST packet for the SYN/ACK packet because it did not send the SYN packet. If there is no host having the spoofed address, however, the SYN/ACK packet is discarded by the network and the server waits in vain for an ACK packet to acknowledge it.

Gathering the necessary information for the decision module to decide if there is a SYN flood attack:
- The observation period (window) W of the monitoring module is 1000 packets for the interval of 250 packets.
- The **fields** to be used for entropy calculations:
    <span style="font-family:Roboto; font-size:1.5em;">F = {dst_ip, src_ip, dst_port, src_port, packet_length} </span>
    Future versions will include several more fields for entropy calculation and the fields will also be combined into sets for calculating entropy as well.
- To calculate entropy we need to get the flow count. In particular, for the SYN attack, packets will only be counted if the Flags are set to: <span style="font-family:Roboto; font-size:1em;"> {(SYN); (ACK); (RST); (FIN); (SYN,ACK); (SYN,RST); (FIN/ACK)} </span>
    For example (10.0.0.1 is an **attribute**):

    |  dst_ip | Flow count  |
    |---------|-------------|
    |10.0.0.1 |   350       |
    |10.0.0.2 |   350       |
    |10.0.0.3 |   300       |

- Pass the flow count information of all fields to the decision module to determine if there is a SYN attack going on.

#### **C. Detection module:**

*[Assigned to Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·ª©c Anh]*
**- SYN Flood:**
Using the flow count we can deduce the probability of each element of the attribute during the window W = 1000, dst_ip for example the first element of dst_ip:

$$P_{dst\_ip_{n}} = F(dst\_ip_{n})/W$$

> With dst_ip in {10.0.0.1; 10.0.0.2; 10.0.0.3}

Consecutively calculate the probability for the remaining element of the field. Once we have all the information, it is time to calculate the entropy:

$$E_{dst\_ip} = -\sum_{n=0}^{M-1}P_{dst\_ip_{n}}log(P_{dst\_ip_{n}}))$$

> With M as the number of elements in dst_ip field.    

    Just like that, calculate the entropies of all attributes.

#### Setup a normal traffic environment to evaluate these threshold values:

- Standard deviation and mean of entropy differences of all attributes for 50000 packets which is 50 windows:
    - Mean of entropy differences of an attribute: 
    $$ m_{diff} = \frac{\sum_{w=0}^{tw-1} \left |E_{attr}(w+1)- E_{attr}(w)\right |}{tw} $$

    > (tw is total of number of windows)

    - Standard deviation of entropy differences of an attribute:
    $$ \sigma_{diff} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{tw}\sum_{w=0}^{tw-1}((E_{attr}(w+1)-E_{attr}(w))-m_{i})^{2}} $$

- Maximum and minimum of entropy differences between consecutive windows in all 50 windows:
    - $$ (E_{attr}(w+1)-E_{attr}(w+1))_{max} $$
    - $$ (E_{attr}(w+1)-E_{attr}(w))_{min} $$

- Maximum and minimum of entropy values of all attributes in all windows:
    - $$ E_{attr}max$$
    - $$ E_{attr}min$$

- Mean and standard deviation of entropy of all attributes (dst_ip, src_ip ...) from 50 windows:

    -  $$ m_{attr}= \frac{\sum_{w=0}^{tw-1}E_{attr}(w)}{tw} $$
    
    - $$ \sigma_{attr} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{tw}\sum_{w=0}^{tw-1}(E_{attr}(w)-m_{attr})^2} $$

We have the entropy values of 5 attributes. With all the information available, determine if there is an attack going on through the following conditions:

#### Raise alert if
- $$ E_{attr}(current) - E_{attr}(prev) > 2 * \sigma_{i} + m_{i} $$
- $$ E_{attr}(current) - E_{attr}(prev) > (E_{w+1}-E_{w})_{max} \; || \; E_{attr}(current) > E_{attr}(max) \; || \; E_{attr}(current) < E_{attr}min$$ 
- $$ ùê∏_{attr}(ùëêùë¢ùëüùëüùëíùëõùë°) <  m_{attr} - \sigma_{i} \; || \; E_{attr}(current) > m_{attr} + \sigma_{i}$$
  
 > with attr = {dst_ip, src_ip, dst_port, src_port, packet_length}
